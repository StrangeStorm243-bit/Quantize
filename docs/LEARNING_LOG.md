# LEARNING_LOG.md — Quantize

A running record of engineering concepts introduced, files studied, and hands-on exercises
completed by the founder. The goal is to build engineering ability *through* this project, not to
treat the founder as a passive PM. Each milestone appends an entry.

How to use this log: when a milestone introduces a concept, we (1) explain the concept in the
context of this repo, (2) point to the file(s) where it lives, (3) give a short reading path, and
(4) propose one small change for the founder to implement by hand. The founder fills in predictions
and outcomes.

## M0 — Foundation & decisions (2026-06-23)

**Concepts introduced (conceptual only — no code yet):**

- **Intermediate Representation (IR) as source of truth.** The strategy is *data*, edited by a UI
  and evaluated by a runtime — neither owns it. Why it matters: it decouples the visual layer from
  execution and makes versioning, reuse, and multiple runtimes possible.
  *Where:* `docs/STRATEGY_LANGUAGE.md` §1.
- **Separating semantics from presentation (`ui.*`).** Coordinates and collapse-state are not part
  of what a strategy *means*. *Where:* `docs/STRATEGY_LANGUAGE.md` §1; invariant in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Look-ahead bias and the session-level engine.** The defining correctness hazard of backtesting,
  and how processing one evaluation instant over an as-of data view **structurally constrains**
  temporal access (and is tested) — without claiming look-ahead is impossible.
  *Where:* `docs/ADRS/0003-...md`, `docs/STRATEGY_LANGUAGE.md` §6.
- **Session-level event lifecycle vs. evaluation schedule.** Why valuation, fills, and stateful
  updates run on session cadence while graph evaluation runs only when scheduled.
  *Where:* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.
- **Adapter pattern at the engine seam.** One engine; Clock/MarketData/Broker/Storage swapped to
  get backtest vs. forward replay. *Where:* `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §3.
- **A type lattice for ports** distinguishing structural shape from financial meaning, with one
  central compatibility function. *Where:* `docs/STRATEGY_LANGUAGE.md` §2.
- **Single source of truth across languages** (Pydantic → JSON Schema → TS) and why duplicated types
  rot. *Where:* `docs/ADRS/0001-...md`.
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).** Why we write down decisions, alternatives, and
  consequences. *Where:* `docs/ADRS/`.

**Reading path (recommended order):** `docs/PRODUCT.md` → `docs/STRATEGY_LANGUAGE.md` §§1–2,6 →
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §§1–3 → `docs/ADRS/0003` then `0001`.

**Exercise (no code; pen-and-paper):** On paper, draw Strategy B as nodes and typed edges using only
the v0 node taxonomy (`STRATEGY_LANGUAGE.md` §3) and label each edge with its port type. Predict:
which single edge in your drawing would the type system *reject* if you accidentally fed a
`TimeSeries[Number]` into a port expecting `CrossSection[Number]`, and which node fixes that?
*Prediction:* ______. *Outcome (after M2):* ______.

**Status:** concepts introduced; first coding exercises arrive with M1 (the IR models) and M2 (a
node implementation you will extend by hand).
